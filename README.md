This is a utility originally written by RusselCS primarily for use with the MM8BDM repository.

The Resource Packer is responsible for taking the contents of a given repository and repackaging them into a format that is friendlier to editors like Ultimate Doom Builder, which otherwise notoriously take a very long time to save and load when using the standard pk3 format for Zandronum mods.

With Russel's permission, I have taken ownership of this utility in order to fix various bugs as well as clean up the code some.
